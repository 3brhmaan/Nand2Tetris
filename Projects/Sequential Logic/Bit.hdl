 * 1-bit register:
 * If load is asserted, the register's value is set to in;
 * Otherwise, the register maintains its current value:
 * if (load(t)) out(t+1) = in(t), else out(t+1) = out(t)

/*
    â€¢ How clock pulse works with 'load' and 'in'
        - wheather it's a high voltage or low voltage when the circuit excutes
        - it put the selected input "in or previous output" "using load" as the flip flop input
        - so in other words , it's sotre the data and waiting for a high voltage only
        - to put it on the output pins to be stored for ever
